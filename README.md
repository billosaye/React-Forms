# React Controlled Component Example

This project demonstrates the concept of controlled components in React using a simple input form. The example illustrates how to manage form data using React's state management.

## Overview

The provided code is a basic React application where a user can type their name into an input field, and the app will dynamically display a greeting with the entered name.

### Features

- **Controlled Input Field:** The input field is a controlled component, meaning its value is tied to the component's state.
- **Dynamic UI Update:** As the user types in their name, the greeting message updates in real-time.
- **State Management:** The `useState` hook is used to manage the input value and reflect changes in the UI.
